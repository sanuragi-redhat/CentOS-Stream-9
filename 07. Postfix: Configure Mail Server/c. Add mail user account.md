    # install mail client program    
    [root@centos-stream9-n1 ~]#  dnf -y install s-nail 
    
    # set environment variables to use Maildir
    [root@centos-stream9-n1 ~]# echo 'export MAIL=$HOME/Maildir' >> /etc/profile.d/mail.sh 
    
To use OS user accounts, that's only adding OS user like follows.
    
    # add a user [cent]
    [root@centos-stream9-n1 ~]# useradd cent
    [root@centos-stream9-n1 ~]# passwd cent
    Changing password for user cent.
    New password: password
    BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
    Retype new password: password
    passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
